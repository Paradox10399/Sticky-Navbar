        <p class="text">The college was established with a definte mission to disseminate a value-oriented quality technical education among our youth to fulfil the increasing demand of human resources for the ever-growing engineering industry of our nation, which it has truly proved to the core. </p>
        <p class="text">The Mohammed Haji Saboo Siddik Institute (A Muslim Minority Institution) owes its existence to the munificence of late Mohammed, son of Haji Saboo Siddik, who bequeathed a large sum of money for establishing, conducting and managing this Institution for imparting Vocational, Technical and Industrial training and education. The value of the assets, so bequeathed, exceeded Rupees Three Crore at the time of donation.

            The Institution is managed and administrated by the Anjuman-i-Islam as the sole trustee, appointed by the Bombay High Court's decree and scheme framed and sanctioned thereunder.
            
            The very well laid out college building accommodates workshops, laboratories, classrooms, lecture halls, drawing halls, students' common room, seminar hall, library, reading-rooms, offices, etc. with modern facilities. The College is accommodated in an exclusively newly-constructed spacious ground plus five floors building. The library of the College is housed in a separate newly-constructed building and is furnished with reference section and reading-rooms for students and staff. A very sophisticated Seminar Hall furnished with the most modern equipment was inaugurated by Dr. Raja Ramanna, an eminent scientist of our country, on the annual day celebrations on 9th April, 2001. A spacious and well-furnished cafeteria is also operative in the campus.</p>

        <p class="text">M. H. Saboo Siddik is an engineering college located in Byculla at Saboo Siddik Polytechnic Road, Mumbai, India, affiliated with the University of Mumbai. It is an 'A' Grade institution, and is accredited by AICTE. The college 154 staff and a student body of about 1200</p>
        <p class="text"><b>Placements:</b> About 75% of the students got placed from our course, i.e., civil engineering. The highest salary package offered to one of our college students who belong to the computer engineering branch was 37 LPA. The lowest salary package offered might be 1.5 LPA, and the average salary package offered is around 5 LPA. Companies like Tata, Toppr, Jio and Google visited our college for recruitment, but only some students got placed. I don't know about internships because I haven't got any internships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I know that very few students get internships from here and not every student. Teachers try to get internships for all students, and also in the college only, they organise many events about internships and placements.</p>
        <p class="text"><b>Infrastructure:</b> The facilities and infrastructure of our college are average. There is a Wi-Fi facility but not for students and only for staff members. Moreover, labs, library and classrooms are good. I don't know about the facilities provided in the hostel because I do not stay in the hostel. However, my friends who stay in the hostel told me that the facilities are good. On the campus, there is a canteen also in which you get a variety of food like vegetarian and non-vegetarian. There is no gymkhana in our college.</p>
        <p class="text"><b>Faculty:</b> Teachers here are very helpful and good also. All teachers are postgraduates, i.e., they all did M.E or M.Tech. Some teachers did a PhD, while one or two teachers are pursuing a PhD, along with teaching. The teaching quality is very good. The curriculum is as per Mumbai University guidelines. Apart from the curriculum, teachers also provide useful knowledge of the field. Semester exams of the first and last year are set by Mumbai University, while the second and third-year exams are conducted in our college only. But papers are set by the university only.</p>
        <p class="text"><b>Other:</b> I chose civil engineering because I am interested in construction. This college is very good for the civil branch. Other branches are also good, and facilities are also good. I suggest our college to provide more internships and site visits. Here events, fest and extracurricular activities are conducted, and they are also very much interesting.</p>
